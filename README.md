The Echoes of Gender is a visual novel focused on gender stereotypes in gaming and their harmful effects, including the experiences of transgender individuals. The game incorporates talking sections with both subtle and obvious sexism and allows players to choose their gender identity, which in turn would determine the game's difficulty levelâ€”created to spread awareness for transphobia, and sexism in the gaming community.

For my outrageous act project for my Women's Gender Studies class, I set out to create this game based on current social issues. In the game, the difficulty and dialogue is determined by the gender identity. Gloria Steinem termed outrageous acts to encourage audiences to turn their outrage into action. "If each person in the room promises that... the very next day she or he will do at least one outrageous thing in the cause of simple justice, then I promise I will, too. It doesn't matter whether the act is as small as saying, "Pick it up yourself" ...or as large as calling a strike..."
